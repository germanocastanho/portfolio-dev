# 👾 Portfolio Dev

A professional portfolio website showcasing my **Data Science** and **AI Engineering** projects. Built with modern web technologies as a single-page application (SPA) - with a little help from GitHub Copilot, since I'm not a front-end developer. Feel free to explore the source code and customize it for your own portfolio! 🚀
